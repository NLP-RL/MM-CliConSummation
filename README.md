### Abstract
With the advancement of telemedicine, both researchers and medical practitioners are working hand-in-hand to develop various techniques to automate various medical operations, such as diagnosis report generation. In this paper, we first present a multimodal clinical conversation summary generation task that takes a clinician-patient interaction (both textual and visual information) and generates a succinct synopsis of the conversation. We propose a knowledge-infused, multi-modal, multi-tasking medical domain identification and clinical conversation summary generation (MMCliConSummation) framework. It leverages an adapter to infuse knowledge and visual features and unify the fused feature vector using a gated mechanism. Furthermore, we developed a multi-modal, multi-intent clinical conversation summarization corpus annotated with intent, symptom, and summary. The extensive set of experiments, both quantitatively and qualitatively, led to the following findings: (a) critical significance of visuals, (b) more precise and medical entity preserving summary with additional knowledge infusion, and (c) a correlation between medical department identification and clinical synopsis generation.
